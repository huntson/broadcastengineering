# Docker Files (Archived)

These Docker files are from the original version of FS-HDR Monitor that supported Docker deployment.

**Current deployment method:** Standalone Windows .exe (see main README.md)

## Files

- `Dockerfile` - Docker container definition
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration

## Note

These files are kept for reference only. The application has been refactored for standalone deployment and no longer requires Docker.

If you need to run this in Docker, you may need to update these files for the current codebase structure.
